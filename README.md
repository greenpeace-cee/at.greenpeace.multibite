# CiviCRM Multibite Extension ðŸ˜²

This CiviCRM extension adds a workaround for the inbound email processor
dropping or truncating emails that contain certain multi-byte characters such
as emojis by replacing it with the Unicode replacement character `ï¿½`.

The Multibite extension is obsolete once CiviCRM
[supports the `utf8mb4` character set](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/issues/339).
A work-in-progress patch for `utf8mb4` [is available as an alternative to this extension](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/13633).

The extension is licensed under [AGPL-3.0](LICENSE.txt).

## Requirements

## Usage

After installing the extension, all 4-byte UTF-8 sequences (which are not
supported by the `utf8` MySQL character set) in the `subject` and `details`
fields of any new "Inbound Email" activity are replaced with the Unicode
replacement character `ï¿½` before they're stored in the database.

The extension performs the same replacement on any text mail parts that go
through the `hook_civicrm_emailProcessor` hook.  This does not affect CiviCRM
by itself, but ensures that other extensions that implement
`hook_civicrm_emailProcessor` receive mail objects that are consistent with
what CiviCRM stored in the database.

The replacement character defaults to `ï¿½` and can be changed via the
`multibite_replacement_character` extension setting.
